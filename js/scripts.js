// The business logic of your application should take a person's age in years and create a class that does the following:

// Returns their age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
// Returns their age in j years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
// Returns their age in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
// Returns their age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
// Determines how many years a user has left to live on each planetâ€¦ (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user's life expectancy. You can determine average life expectancy as you see fit. A simple way to do this would be to have the user input the average life expectancy for their demographic. A more involved way to do this would be to collect other information from the user (e.g. lifestyle, country of residence, activity level, etc.) to determine their life expectancy.
// If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy. The number of years lived past life expectancy should be a positive number.
